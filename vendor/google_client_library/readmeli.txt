This folder /google_client_library/ came from the webroot/vendor folder.
It was created by Composer, when I installed Google Client Library.
I then renamed this to /google_client_library/ and placed it in eol_php_code/vendor/google_client_library
The original /vendor/ folder is in the webroot/vendor.

This is for the PHP client to access Google Sheets.
Sample script is the quickstart.php

*I've also created /json/ folder here. And updated autoload.php accordingly

*This is all based here:
