This folder /google_client_lib_2023/ came from the webroot/google_client_lib_2023/vendor/ folder.
It was created by Composer, when I installed Google Client Library.
I then renamed this to /google_client_lib_2023/ and placed it in eol_php_code/vendor/google_client_lib_2023
The original /vendor/ folder is in the webroot/google_client_lib_2023.

This is for the PHP client to access Google Sheets.
Sample script is the webroot/google_client_lib_2023/test.php

*I've also created /json/ folder here. And updated autoload.php accordingly
